## About Koyeb and the Ollama model bundle example application

Koyeb is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. No-ops, servers, or infrastructure management.

This repository is designed to show how to deploy an Ollama instance with a model bundle in the Docker container to Koyeb. The `Dockerfile` allows for configuration through environment variables to make deployment and configuration more straightforward. By default, the image deploys Ollama with the [`gemma2:2b` model](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2:2b), but this is configurable using the `MODEL_NAME` environment variable.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to deploy an Ollama instance to your Koyeb account.

### Requirements

To use this repository, you need:

- A Koyeb account to build the `Dockerfile` and deploy it to the platform. If you don't already have an account, you can [sign-up for free](https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup).

### Deploy using the Koyeb button

The fastest way to deploy an Ollama instance is to click the **Deploy to Koyeb** button below.

[![Deploy to Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?name=koyeb-ollama-model-bundle&type=git&repository=koyeb%2Fexample-ollama-model-bundle&branch=main&builder=dockerfile&instance_type=gpu-nvidia-rtx-4000-sff-ada&env%5BMODEL_LIST%5D=gemma2:2b&hc_grace_period%5B8000%5D=300)

Clicking on this button brings you to the Koyeb App creation page with most of the settings pre-configured to launch this application. You will need to configure the following environment variables:

- `MODEL_NAME`: Set this to the name of the model you wish to use, as given on the Ollama site. You can check [what models Ollama supports](https://ollama.com/search) to find out more. Click the model name copy icon on the Hugging Face page to copy the appropriate value. If not provided, the `gemma2:2b` model will be deployed.
